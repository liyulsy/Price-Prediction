- **[May 2025]** Added a script for **hyperparameter tuning** using Optuna under `./scripts/HyperParameter_Tuning/`. These scripts explore optimal hyperparameter settings for ETT dataset.


## Get started
Follow these steps to get started with WPMixer:
### 1. Install Requirements
Install Python 3.10 and the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Download Data
<b>Process-1:</b>
Download the zip file of the datasets from the [link](https://usf.box.com/s/8ghqgtxfp1hw3rfvocr2s5gjf7w4x3ol).
Paste the zip file inside the <u>root folder</u> and extract. Now you will have ```./data/``` folder containing all the datasets.
 
Or, 
<b>Process-2:</b>
Download the data and locate them in the ```./data/``` folder. You can download all data from the public GitHub repo: [Autoformer](https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer) or [TimeMixer](https://github.com/kwuking/TimeMixer). All the datasets are well-pre-processed and can be used easily. To place and rename the datasets file, check the following folder tree,
```
data
├── electricity
│   └── electricity.csv
├── ETT
│   ├── ETTh1.csv
│   ├── ETTh2.csv
│   ├── ETTm1.csv
│   └── ETTm2.csv
├── exchange_rate
│   └── exchange_rate.csv
├── illness
│   └── national_illness.csv
├── m4
├── solar
│   └── solar_AL.txt
├── traffic
│   └── traffic.csv
└── weather
    └── weather.csv
```

    
### 3. Train the model
We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder ```./scripts/``` to reproduce the results. Running those scripts by the following commands will generate logs in the ```./logs/WPMixer/``` folder.

<p><strong>Abstract</p>
Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather forecasting, power load forecasting, and financial analysis. In recent studies, MLP-mixer models for time series forecasting have been shown as a promising alternative to transformer-based models. However, the performance of these models is still yet to reach its potential. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Patch Mixer (WPMixer), a novel MLP-based model, for long-term time series forecasting, which leverages the benefits of patching, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and mixing. Our model is based on three key components: (i) multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, (ii) patching and embedding, and (iii) MLP mixing. Multi-resolution wavelet decomposition efficiently extracts information in both the frequency and time domains. Patching allows the model to capture an extended history with a look-back window and enhances capturing local information while MLP mixing incorporates global information. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLP-based and transformer-based models for long-term time series forecasting in a computationally efficient way, demonstrating its efficacy and potential for practical applications.
